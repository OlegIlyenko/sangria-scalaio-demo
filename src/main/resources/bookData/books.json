This autobiography was completed in 1769, but was actually not published until 1782. It is a unique autobiography in the fact that Rousseau wrote about even his most humiliating moments. Rousseau also writes about how he \"disposed\" of his five children, whom he had out of marriage with Theresa Levasseur.",
